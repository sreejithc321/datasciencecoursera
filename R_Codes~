Dataset : hw1_data.csv

In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

Answer

Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day

Explanation

You can get the column names of a data frame with the 'names()' function.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> names(hw1)
[1] "Ozone"   "Solar.R" "Wind"    "Temp"    "Month"   "Day"
Question 12

Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

Answer

  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
Explantion

You can extract the first two rows using the [ operator and an integer sequence to index the rows.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> hw1[c(1,2),]
  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
Question 13

How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

Answer

153

Explanation

You can use the 'nrows()' function to compute the number of rows in a data frame.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> nrow(hw1)
[1] 153
Question 14

Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

Answer

   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30
Explanation

The 'tail()' function is an easy way to extract the last few elements of an R object.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> tail(hw1,2)
    Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30
Question 15

What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

Answer

21

Explanation

The single bracket [ operator can be used to extract individual rows of a data frame.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> hw1[15,]
   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
15    18      65 13.2   58     5  15
Question 16

How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?

Answer

37

Explanation

The 'is.na' function can be used to test for missing values.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, is.na(Ozone))
> nrow(sub)
[1] 37
Question 17

What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

Answer

42.1

Explanation

The 'mean' function can be used to calculate the mean.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, !is.na(Ozone), select = Ozone)
> apply(sub, 2, mean)
   Ozone 
42.12931 
Question 18

Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

Answer

212.8

Explanation

You need to construct a logical vector in R to match the question's requirements. Then use that logical vector to subset the data frame.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, Ozone > 31 & Temp > 90, select = Solar.R)
> apply(sub, 2, mean)
Solar.R 
  212.8 
Question 19

What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?

Answer

79.1

Explanation

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, Month == 6, select = Temp)
> apply(sub, 2, mean)
Temp 
79.1
Question 20

What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?

Answer

115

Explantion

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, Month == 5 & !is.na(Ozone), select = Ozone)
> apply(sub, 2, max)
Ozone 
  115
